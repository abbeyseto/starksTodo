# Kanban/Todo Mobile Application

This a simple and functional mobile-based to-do list/kanban mobile application built with React Native (it uses node.js for back-end) that makes requests to the Google Calendar API and utilizes a noSQL database (MongoDB) for different parts of the application.

Files such as pictures, pdf etc will be attachable to items on the to-do list. [Coming soon..]
Views for all items in a day, week and month should be available.  
Can create events with notifications on google calendar.
