This a simple and functional mobile-based to-do list/kanban mobile application built with React Native (it uses node.js for back-end) that makes requests to the Google Calendar API and utilizes both an SQL and a noSQL database for different parts of the application.        Files such as pictures, pdf etc should be attachable to items on the to-do list.  Views for all items in a day, week and month should be available.  Can create events with notifications on google calendar.
